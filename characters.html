     <p>Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks, is a gentle and kind-hearted man with a low IQ, who often finds himself in extraordinary situations. Despite his cognitive limitations, Forrest's innocence, honesty, and unwavering optimism lead him to achieve remarkable successes in various aspects of life. He becomes a college football star, a Vietnam War hero, a successful shrimp boat captain, and even inspires significant cultural and historical moments, often without fully understanding their importance.

    Forrest's character is defined by his simplicity and straightforwardness, which contrasts sharply with the complexities of the world around him. His love for his childhood friend, Jenny, remains a constant driving force in his life. Through his pure-hearted and sincere nature, Forrest touches the lives of those he encounters, embodying the idea that one doesn't have to be intellectually gifted to live a meaningful and impactful life.</p>

      <p>Jenny Curran, portrayed by Robin Wright in "Forrest Gump," is a complex and deeply troubled character who serves as the love interest of Forrest Gump. Jenny's life is marked by trauma and hardship from an early age, growing up in an abusive household, which profoundly affects her choices and outlook on life. Despite her turbulent path, including struggles with drug addiction, abusive relationships, and a wandering lifestyle, Jenny remains a pivotal figure in Forrest's life.

Jenny's relationship with Forrest is complicated. While she cares for him deeply and recognizes his unconditional love and loyalty, she often distances herself due to her own insecurities and need to escape her past. Her journey is one of searching for identity and belonging, and although she makes many mistakes, she eventually seeks redemption and stability.

In the latter part of the story, Jenny reconnects with Forrest, and they share a brief period of happiness, including the birth of their son, Forrest Jr. Jenny's character highlights themes of forgiveness, the long-lasting impact of childhood trauma, and the possibility of redemption and finding peace. Despite her flaws and struggles, Jenny's enduring bond with Forrest underscores the film's messages about love and the complexities of the human experience.
